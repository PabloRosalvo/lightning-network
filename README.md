## What areas of the application did you focus on?
I focused on the architecture, where MVVM-C, protocol-oriented, was used. Facilitating application testing. 

##What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?

My focus was to create an application with separate responsibilities, to facilitate maintenance.
## How much time did you spend on this project?

2 days, as I had to do it in my spare time.

## Did you make any compensation on this project? What would you have done differently with more time?

I would have evolved, made it more abstract and covered 100% of the project. 

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

Test coverage is one of them, as I didn't have much time to focus on the project I could improve this project much more.

## Is there any other information you would like us to know?

In English or Portuguese, static strings are changed automatically.  

In the coordinator I used closures more to demonstrate knowledge, but I like using the Design Pattern Delegate more.
